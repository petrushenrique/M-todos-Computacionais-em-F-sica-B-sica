1. (a) Show that the equations that govern the pressure as a
function of the radial distance from the center of a spherical
gaseous planet, in which the density is proportional to the
pressure ( $\rho = kp$), are $dp/dr = -(Gm/r^2)kp$ and $dm/dr =
4 r^2 kp$, where m is the mass contained within the sphere of
radius r. (b) Numerically integrate these coupled equations
outward from the point $r_0$ , where $r 0 = 10^3 m$, $p_0 = 2 \times 10^{16}
Pa$, $m_0 = 7 \times 10^{14} kg$. Take the constant $k$ to be $8 \times 10^12
s^2/m^2$ . Generate a graph of pressure against radial distance. (c)
At what distance is the pressure less than one atmosphere?

A cylindrical water tank has a radius of 2 m and a height of 1.5 m.
Originally the tank is completely filled with water, but a vertical
crack appears in the tank and the water leaks out. Assuming the
crack is 1 cm wide and extends from the base of the tank to the
top, calculate the amount of time for the tank to completely
empty. (Hint: Assume the crack is composed of 1 cm 2 holes, each
one on top of the other, and solve the problem numerically.
